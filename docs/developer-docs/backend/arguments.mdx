# Passing arguments

## Overview 

This document aims to provide examples of passing different argument types to a canister.

## Arrays

An `array` is a collection of items of the same data type.

The following example defines an array of numbers and a function that returns the array.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko">

Motoko differentiates between immutable arrays, which cannot be altered, and mutable arrays, which can be modified.

To declare an immutable array (default):

```motoko
let a : [Nat] = [0, 1, 2, 3];
```

To declare a mutable array, the `[var _]` syntax is used:

```
let a : [var Nat] = [var 0, 1, 2, 3] ;
```

To declare a function that returns an array:

```
public func get_numbers(a: [Nat]) : [Nat] {
    return a;
}
```

The `Array` Motoko base library provides utility functions on arrays. To learn more about the `Array` Motoko base library, refer to the [Motoko base library reference on Array](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Array) and the [Motoko language quick reference on arrays](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual/#arrays).

Rust uses the `vec` type to represent vectors (sequences, lists, arrays).

```rust
let numbers = vec![0, 1, 2, 3 ];
#[query]
fn get_numbers(numbers: Vec<u32>) -> Vec<u32> {
    numbers
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

Azle refers to the `Vec` type to represent the equivalent of an `array` in Typescript. This is because `Vec` aligns with the [Candid](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/candid-concepts) type.

```typescript
import { Canister, int32, Vec, query } from 'azle';
let numbers = [0,1,2,3];
export default Canister({
    get_numbers: query([Vec(int32], Vec(int32), () => {
        return numbers;
    })
});
```


To learn more about the `Vec` object in Typescript via Azle, refer to [the Azle book reference on Vec](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/reference/candid/vec.html?highlight=array#vec).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

Kybra refers to the `Vec` type to represent the equivalent of an `array` in Python. This is because `Vec` aligns with the Candid type.

```python
from kybra import int32, query, Vec
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3]
@query
def get_numbers(Vec[int32]) -> Vec[int32]:
    return numbers
```

<TabItem value="bash" label="bash">

You can pass a vector as an argument by explicitly specifying the canister name and method name using the `dfx` tool in the following format:

```bash
    dfx canister call canister_name method_name '(vec {})'
```
Assuming you have a method named `get_numbers` that accepts a `Vec` parameter, as exemplified in other examples:

```bash
    dfx canister call canister_name get_numbers '(vec {1; 2; 3})'
```
To learn more about calling a method from a canister in bash, refer to the dfx reference on the [dfx canister call command](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call). 

For additional examples, refer to [type `vec` in the Candid Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/candid-ref#type-vec-t).

## Variants

A `variant` type represents a value that is from exactly one of the given cases, or **tags**. Similar to enums, they let you differentiate between different types within the same variable.

The following example defines a `Day` type representing a day of the week. It utilizes a switch statement to match the input `Day` with one of its variants, returning the corresponding full name of the day.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```motoko
type Day = {#sun; #mon; #tue; #wed; #thu; #fri; #sat};

public query func get_text(d : Day) : Text {
  switch d {
     case (#sun) "Sunday";
     case (#mon) "Monday";
     case (#tue) "Tuesday";
     case (#wed) "Wednesday";
     case (#thu) "Thursday";
     case (#fri) "Friday";
     case (#sat) "Saturday";
   };
};
```
For additional examples, refer to the [Type variant reference in Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/overview/#variants).
