# Large web assembly modules

## Overview

The size of programs that can be installed on ICP is currently limited to 2MB.
WebAssembly modules that are (slightly) larger than 2MB can still be installed on ICP by using gzip file compression before uploading; ICP will then decompress the file and install the contained WebAssembly module.

## Installing a gzip-compressed WebAssembly module

The WebAssembly module is compressed using `gzip` and then uploaded by `dfx install`, you may need to add `--mode reinstall` or `--mode upgrade` when uploading the module to an existing canister.

``` bash
gzip my-canister.wasm
dfx canister install my-canister --wasm my-canister.wasm.gz
```

Compression is currently not supported by `dfx deploy`.
