# Development cycle

## Overview

New canisters are created for each individual WebAssembly module that should be run. When a canister is created, it will be assigned a canister ID. There is no central registry of canisters, meaning developers (or more likely their [tools](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview)) have to keep track of their canister IDs. Once code is deployed to canisters, the canister IDs can be used to [call the functions](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/call/overview) of other canisters.

## Cycle consumption 

Canisters consume [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost) while they're running. Performing computation costs cycles, and so does storing data. As long as a canister is running it has to contain enough cycles to maintain operations. This is another place where developers (or their tools) need to keep track of IDs and/or cycles balances. If a canister runs very low on cycles, it will be frozen, meaning it won't respond to update calls anymore, and if it runs out entirely, it will be deleted.

## Access control

Not everyone is allowed to change a canister. Canisters all have a list of [controllers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/control) that are allowed to update its [settings](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/settings), [install/upgrade](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/upgrade) the running code or even [delete the canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/delete). Developers, automated tools, other canisters or nothing at all can be controllers. Depending on the goals for the canister, different combinations of controllers can make sense.

## Canister lifecycle 

A canister's lifecycle follows this general outline:

- A canister is created by compiling code into Wasm, then installing the Wasm into a new canister.

- Once a canister is created, it can be deployed to ICP. The canister's ID (address) is returned. The developer account that created the canister is a controller of the canister by default.

- A canister runs on ICP and provides a service or function. The canister is interacted with through calls from users or other canisters.

- The canister is maintained by its controllers (developer, DAO, etc) through upgrades, starting, stopping, changing settings, or being topped-up with cycles.

- A canister is deleted once it is no longer needed or isn't maintained in such that it runs out of cycles. 

## Installing canister code

While canisters can run arbitrary WebAssembly (Wasm) modules, ICP has a few conventions that make it easier to get the most out of its capabilities. For example, the function `canister_init` is the first function that gets called after the code is installed for the first time. To facilitate adhering to those conventions, Canister Development Kits (CDKs) exist for [many different languages](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview).

To install code in a canister, the `install_code` function of ICP is used in one of three modes:
- The `install` mode is the one every canister starts with: it is only callable for canisters without any installed code and populates the canister with the supplied Wasm module. Once installation is complete, the aforementioned function `canister_init` (usually exposed as `init` in CDKs) is called if it exists. This allows the code to perform any required setup before any calls arrive.
- The `reinstall` mode works almost the same as `install`, but if the canister already contains running code, its state is discarded and the running code is deleted. After that, the procedure from mode `install` is followed.
- The `upgrade` mode is the one used most often. This mode allows canister code to be changed without losing all of its state. In this mode, the canister first has the chance to save any state to stable memory in the `canister_pre_upgrade` (exposed as `pre_upgrade` in CDKs) function. After that, the new code is installed and instead of calling the init function, the `canister_post_upgrade` function (exposed as `post_upgrade` in CDKs) is run so that data can be loaded from stable memory.

All three `install_code` modes are atomic. If **anything** goes wrong in one of the described steps, the canister state is reverted to its state before the `install_code` function was called. And in case anything is not clear enough from these explanations, the [IC specification for `install_code`](/references/ic-interface-spec.md#ic-install_code) is the official source of truth.

:::caution
Every function call on ICP has a limit to how many instructions can be executed. If your `pre_upgrade` function exceeds this limit, it will be canceled and the upgrade fails. This can make a canister un-upgradeable. The wiki [contains some ideas](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Dealing_with_cycles_limit_exceeded_errors) how one can work around the cycles limit.
:::

When upgrading existing canisters, there are a few more things that one should keep in mind:
- **Outstanding callbacks**: if a canister is `await`ing a response from another canister, it can be upgraded in-between sending and receiving a response. If the code is installed in `upgrade` mode, the callback will be executed as if no upgrade has been made. If this should not happen, the canister should either first be stopped, or the code has to be uninstalled and then installed again.
- **Interface compatibility**: if canisters or scripts expect the upgraded canister to have a certain interface, upgrades can break existing workflows. `dfx` will warn the user (if possible) that the upgrade will break certain signatures, but there are always corner cases that may be missed.
